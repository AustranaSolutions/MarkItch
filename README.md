# MarkItch

> Werbung wird zum Entertainment.

Ein Kurzvideo-Feed wie TikTok/Reels, in dem **nur Marken posten**. Sie treten
gegeneinander an, und die Community stimmt ab. Austrana Solutions KG, Österreich.

**Live:** https://markitch.vercel.app · **Native App:** [AustranaSolutions/MarkItch-mobile](https://github.com/AustranaSolutions/MarkItch-mobile)

## Stand (Oktober 2026)

- **Web-App live**, alle Formate fertig:
  - Solo-Pitch, Duell (7 Tage Abstimmung, Ergebnis verdeckt), Reaktion,
  - Creator-Challenge (monatlich, meiste Likes gewinnen),
  - Partner-Casting (Marken bewerben sich als Partner, Community wählt),
  - Link-Knopf unter jedem Video, Folgen, Benachrichtigungen, Suche/Trends,
  - Kommentare mit Filter (Wortliste, keine Links, Spam-Bremse) und Löschen, Melden/Blockieren, Moderation,
  - Marken-Statistik inkl. Link-Klicks und Zahlen pro Video (`/dashboard`, App: `/api/mobile/stats`).
- **Feed** in zwei Stufen (`src/lib/feed.ts`): Reihenfolge aus schlanken Daten, volle Karten nur für die angefragte Seite.
- **Rollen:** *Acro* = Marken-Konto (darf posten), *Assent* = Zuschauer (schaut, stimmt ab, folgt).
- **Dieses Repo ist auch das Backend der nativen App:** alle `/api/mobile/*`-Routen (Bearer-Token-Auth).
- **Native iOS-App** (Expo/React Native) läuft auf Testgeräten. Für den App Store fehlt noch der Apple-Developer-Account.
- **Boost** (19 € für 48 h Ranking-Bonus) ist gebaut, aber pausiert (`src/lib/feature-flags.ts`).
- Noch keine echten Nutzer, getestet wird mit Demo-Marken.
- **Sicherheit:** RLS auf allen Tabellen, eindeutige Markennamen + Verifiziert-Haken (`/admin/brands`), Uploads pro Konto mit Dateityp-Prüfung und täglichem Aufräumen (`/api/cron/cleanup-uploads`, braucht `CRON_SECRET`), Admin-Routen nur per Header `x-admin-key`. Fahrplan: `MARKITCH-AUDIT-2026-10-04.md` (Desktop-Ordner).

Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) · Tailwind CSS 4 · Drizzle ORM · Postgres
(Supabase) · Auth.js v5 (Credentials) · Supabase Storage für Videos · Vercel.

**Schema-Änderungen in Produktion:** Migrationen liegen in `drizzle/`. Nach dem Deploy
`curl -X POST -H "x-admin-key: <ADMIN_SEED_KEY>" https://markitch.vercel.app/api/admin/migrate` aufrufen (nur per Header, seit Oktober 2026). Neue Spalten an bestehenden
Tabellen in zwei Schritten ausrollen: erst nur die Migration pushen und ausführen,
dann `schema.ts` und den Code.
Jede neue Tabelle bekommt in ihrer Migration sofort `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` (siehe `drizzle/0036_enable_rls.sql`).

Abschnitt 3 unten ist die ursprüngliche Phasen-Historie (englisch, Phasen 1–12).
Spätere Phasen sind dort nicht mehr nachgetragen; der aktuelle Funktionsumfang steht oben.

## 1. Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET, APP_URL
npm run db:generate          # only needed after changing src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:migrate           # applies drizzle/*.sql to the database in DATABASE_URL
npm run dev
```

Generate `AUTH_SECRET` with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

Without `RESEND_API_KEY` set, verification and password-reset emails aren't actually
sent — the link is printed to the server console instead (`[email] ... link=...`).
That's enough to test the whole flow solo.

## 2. Data model

`src/db/schema.ts`:

- **users** — id, email (unique), passwordHash, name, emailVerifiedAt, timestamps.
- **email_verification_tokens** / **password_reset_tokens** — single-use, hashed
  (SHA-256) tokens with an expiry (24h / 1h). The raw token only ever exists in the
  emailed link, never stored.
- **brands** — id, name, slug (unique, auto-generated from name), description,
  logoUrl, website, category, country, timestamps.
- **brand_members** — brandId + userId + role. A join table rather than an `ownerId`
  column on `brands`, so adding teams/roles later is additive, not a migration. Phase
  2 enforces one brand per user at the application level (see
  `src/app/actions/brand.ts`) — the schema doesn't stop it, so lifting that limit
  later is a one-line change.
- **brands.videoUrl / videoUploadedAt** — one showcase video per brand (Phase 3). A
  brand's actual battle submissions get their own table once Phase 5 needs it; this
  is just "the video on my public profile" for now.
- **challenges** (Phase 4) — challengerBrandId, challengedBrandId, status
  (pending/accepted/declined/expired), expiresAt (createdAt + `CHALLENGE_WINDOW_MS`,
  2 weeks by default — see Phase 5.1 below), respondedAt, timestamps. Partial unique
  index on (challenger, challenged) WHERE status='pending'.
- **battles** (Phase 5) — challengeId (unique — one battle per accepted challenge),
  brandAId, brandBId, status ('active' for now), createdAt. Still uses each brand's
  `videoUrl` from Phase 3 rather than a separate per-battle submission — that split
  only matters once a brand needs different content per battle, which isn't yet.
- **follows** (Phase 5.1) — userId + brandId, unique per pair. A user following a
  brand, so they can be notified about that brand's next battle.
- **notifications** (Phase 5.1) — userId, message, battleId (nullable), readAt,
  createdAt. In-app only for now — see Phase 5.1 notes below.
- **votes** (Phase 6) — battleId, userId, votedForBrandId, createdAt. Unique index
  on (battleId, userId) — the real enforcement of one vote per user per battle; the
  app also checks first for a friendlier error message.
- **battles** got extended in Phase 7 rather than getting a new table: `mode`
  ('scheduled' | 'open'), `category` (currently always the one constant format —
  see PITCH_CATEGORY in `src/lib/battle-format.ts`), `brandAVideoUrl` /
  `brandBVideoUrl` (per-battle video, replacing the old reuse of the brand's
  profile showcase video), `brandASubmittedAt` / `brandBSubmittedAt`,
  `productionDeadline` (scheduled mode only), `votingEndsAt`. `challengeId` is now
  nullable — an 'open' battle has no challenge behind it. Nothing about a battle's
  current stage (awaiting videos / voting / finished) or winner is stored — it's
  computed at read time from these fields, same philosophy as challenges'
  effectiveStatus(). See `src/lib/battle-stage.ts`.

- **comments** (Phase 8) — battleId, userId, content, createdAt. Flat, no threading —
  a TikTok/Reels-style list under a Pitch, newest first.
- **likes** (Phase 9) — battleId + brandId + userId, unique per triple. A generic
  "like this video" heart, one per user per battle-*side* (a battle has two videos,
  each with its own like count) — deliberately separate from `votes`: a like is a
  free, repeatable reaction, a vote is the one-per-battle "who wins" decision. A
  viewer can like both sides of a Pitch but can only vote for one.

More tables get added in later phases, on top of this.

## 3. What's implemented (Phasen-Historie 1–12)

**Phase 1 — accounts:**

- `/register` — create account, auto-login, verification email sent.
- `/login`, logout (button on `/profile`).
- `/verify-email?token=...` — confirms the address.
- `/forgot-password` → email with reset link → `/reset-password?token=...`.
- `/profile` — shows account status, "resend verification email", change password.
- `proxy.ts` redirects signed-out users away from `/profile` and signed-in users away
  from `/login` and `/register` (optimistic check; real checks happen server-side in
  `src/lib/session.ts` and the server actions in `src/app/actions/auth.ts`).

**Phase 2 — brands:**

- `/profile` — shows a "Meine Marke" card: the create-brand form if the user has none
  yet, otherwise a link to their brand.
- Create-brand form: name, description, category, country, website, logo upload
  (PNG/JPEG/WEBP/SVG, max 2 MB). One brand per user for now.
- `/brands/[slug]` — public brand profile page (logo, name, category, country,
  description, website). No auth required to view.
- `src/lib/storage.ts` — logo upload, local disk in dev, Supabase Storage in prod (see
  §5). Slug collisions (two brands named the same) get `-2`, `-3`, ... appended.

**Phase 3 — video:**

- `/profile` — once a brand exists, a "Video" card: upload (or replace) a short
  vertical video (MP4/WEBM/MOV, max 50 MB).
- Shows on both `/profile` and the public `/brands/[slug]` page as a 9:16 HTML5
  `<video>` player.
- "Verarbeitung" (processing) for this phase is upload + storage — there's no
  transcoding/thumbnailing pipeline yet (ffmpeg isn't available in a default Vercel
  serverless function), so the pending state during a slow mobile upload *is* the
  processing step for now. Revisit once video needs normalizing for the actual battle
  feed.
- Uses `refresh()` (from `next/cache`, new in Next.js 16) after the upload — Server
  Actions no longer auto-refresh the invoking route's server-rendered data, so without
  it the new video wouldn't show up on `/profile` until a manual reload.

**Phase 4 — challenges:**

- `/brands` — public list of all brands (discovery, so there's something to challenge).
- `/brands/[slug]` — logged-in visitors with their own brand see a "Herausfordern" button
  (hidden on their own brand's page, or once a live challenge already exists between the
  two brands in either direction).
- `/profile` — a "Herausforderungen" card: incoming challenges (with Annehmen/Ablehnen)
  and outgoing challenges (with status).
- 24h window to accept/decline. No cron job — `effectiveStatus()` in `src/lib/challenge.ts`
  computes "expired" from `expiresAt` at read time, so a stale row is correct the moment
  anyone looks, regardless of how long it's been. `respondToChallenge` additionally
  persists the `expired` status the first time someone tries to act on a stale one.
- A partial unique index (`challenges_challenger_challenged_pending_idx`) stops the same
  brand from firing off duplicate *pending* challenges in the same direction at the DB
  level; the opposite-direction and general "already have a live one" checks are
  application-level (`getLivePendingChallengeBetween`).

**Phase 5 — battle:**

- Accepting a challenge (`respondToChallenge`) automatically inserts a row in the new
  `battles` table — a battle is just "this accepted challenge, viewed as a head-to-head
  page". One battle per challenge (unique index on `challenge_id`).
- `/battles` — public list of all battles (brand vs. brand).
- `/battles/[id]` — both brands' showcase videos side by side (9:16 players, stacked on
  mobile via `sm:flex-row`), reachable logged-out. If a brand hasn't uploaded a video
  yet, shows a placeholder instead of a broken player.
- On `/profile`, an accepted challenge's status badge becomes a "Battle ansehen" link
  straight to its battle page (both `getIncomingChallenges`/`getOutgoingChallenges` now
  left-join `battles` on `challenge_id` to get this for free).
- `battles.status` defaults to `'active'` — unused until Phase 6, which is what will
  flip it to `'finished'` once voting closes.

**Phase 5.1 — refinements (product feedback, before Phase 6):**

- **Challenge window extended 24h → 2 weeks.** No brand can shoot a real marketing
  video in a day, and a brand fielding several challenges at once needs even more
  room, not less. `CHALLENGE_WINDOW_MS` in `src/lib/challenge.ts` is the one place
  this is tuned — currently 14 days as a starting assumption. Note: accepting a
  challenge today still immediately creates the battle using each brand's existing
  showcase video (see the `battles` note above) rather than opening a dedicated
  production window per battle — that's the more accurate long-term fix if 2 weeks
  ever turns out to still be too tight, but it's a bigger schema change (per-battle
  video + its own deadline) than today's ask called for, so it's flagged here rather
  than half-built.
- **Follow + notify.** `/brands/[slug]` now shows a follower count and a
  Folgen/Folgt-Button (hidden for your own brand, and for logged-out visitors, who
  still see the count). The moment a challenge is accepted, everyone following
  *either* brand gets an in-app notification ("Battle Cola battelt jetzt gegen
  Battle Fanta!") shown on `/profile`, linking straight to the battle. No
  push/email yet — a follower has to open the app and check `/profile` to see it;
  that's the natural next step once real users are testing this beyond one device.
  A user following both brands in a battle currently gets two notifications rather
  than one merged one — a deliberate rough edge, not a bug.
- **Battle page redesigned as a single-video viewer, not side-by-side.** Two 9:16
  videos next to each other left almost nothing visible on a phone. `/battles/[id]`
  now shows one brand's video at a time (`BattleViewer` in
  `src/components/battle/battle-viewer.tsx`) with a tab bar to flip between the two
  — closer to how people actually watch vertical video, and leaves room for an
  actual swipe gesture later without a data-model change.

**Phase 6 — voting:**

- `/battles/[id]` now has a "WER HAT GEWONNEN?" panel below the video viewer: two
  vote buttons before you've voted, a live percentage bar for each brand (with a 👑
  on whoever's ahead) after you have. One vote per logged-in user per battle,
  enforced by a unique DB index (`src/db/schema.ts`) — `castVote` in
  `src/app/actions/vote.ts` also checks first, for a clean error message instead of
  a raw constraint violation.
- A brand's own team (checked via `brand_members`) can't vote in its own battle —
  otherwise a brand could just vote itself to the top. Logged-out visitors see the
  live tally and a "Anmelden, um abzustimmen" prompt instead of vote buttons.
- **No voting deadline.** `battles.status` stays `'active'` — the tally is live and
  ongoing ("who's ahead right now"), not a poll that closes and locks in a winner.
  That's a deliberate simplification: the original idea of flipping to `'finished'`
  (mentioned in the Phase 5 notes above) would need a real reason to pick a closing
  rule — a fixed season, a per-battle expiry — and nothing in the current product
  called for one yet. Easy to add later without a schema change (`battles.status`
  is already there, just unused).
- `/battles` shows a vote-count badge per battle card, so there's a reason to check
  back on a battle you haven't voted in yet.
- Tested for the classic edge cases: an exact 50/50 split renders as two 50% bars
  with no 👑 on either side (not a crash or a false "leader"), and a single vote
  flips the 👑 correctly once the tie breaks.

**Phase 7 — per-battle video, hidden results, open counters:**

Direct follow-up to product feedback after Phase 6 — three changes, all in
`src/lib/battle-format.ts`, `src/lib/battle-stage.ts`, `src/app/actions/battle.ts`:

- **Real per-battle video, verdeckt.** A 'scheduled' battle (from an accepted
  challenge) no longer reuses each brand's general profile video — it starts with
  neither video, `productionDeadline` 2 weeks out, and is invisible/unvotable
  (`awaiting_videos` stage) until **both** brands have uploaded their own video for
  *this* battle via `uploadBattleVideo`. Neither side can see or react to the
  other's video before posting their own. If the deadline passes with only one
  side in, that side wins by walkover; if neither delivered, the battle is simply
  never contested (no winner) — no separate "cancelled" state needed, both are
  just computed outcomes of `getBattleStage()`.
- **Results hidden until voting closes.** The moment both videos are in,
  `votingEndsAt` is set (now + `VOTING_WINDOW_MS`, 1 week) and voting opens — but
  `VotePanel` only shows the total vote count during that week, never the split or
  a leader. This is deliberate: showing the live split risks a bandwagon effect
  (people stop voting for whoever's already behind), which defeats the point of a
  real week-long contest. The total count still shows for FOMO/social proof
  ("340 Stimmen abgegeben"). The split, the 👑, and the winner only appear once
  `votingEndsAt` has passed.
- **Open counters — no permission needed.** Any brand can react to another
  brand's public showcase video with their own, no challenge/accept step —
  `counterWithVideo` in `src/app/actions/battle.ts`, triggered by a "⚔️ Kontern"
  button on `/brands/[slug]`. This exists specifically so a brand nobody has
  challenged (a new startup, say) isn't stuck waiting to be picked — it can jump
  into a battle on its own initiative, the same way anyone can duet/stitch a
  TikTok without asking. The countered video is copied into the new battle at the
  moment of countering (not live-referenced), so it can't shift under an ongoing
  battle if the original brand later replaces their profile video. Both videos
  exist the instant the battle is created, so an 'open' battle skips
  `awaiting_videos` entirely and goes straight to `voting`.
- The "battle is live, vote now" follower notification (from Phase 5.1) now fires
  when both videos actually land — `activateBattleIfBothSidesReady()` — not at
  challenge-acceptance, since acceptance no longer means anything is watchable yet.
- **Known rough edge:** battles created before this phase have no
  `productionDeadline`/`votingEndsAt` and fall back to each brand's profile video
  (`resolveBattleVideos()` in `src/lib/battle.ts`) so they don't just break — but
  since nothing ever sets `votingEndsAt` for them, they stay in a perpetually-open
  "voting" stage (never reaching a revealed result) rather than being backfilled.
  Harmless for the handful of test battles that predate this migration; not a
  concern for anything created from here on.

Deliberately out of scope: any ranking/ELO across battles, and a category picker
(there's one fixed category for now — see `PITCH_CATEGORY`).

**Phase 8 — roles (Acro/Assent) and a friendlier vocabulary:**

Product feedback: "Battle/Herausfordern/Kontern" reads as combat, not as a stage for
the best marketing pitch, and every user was implicitly a brand — there was no way to
just watch and vote without also being able to post. Two changes, both purely
additive (no battle-stage logic touched):

- **Roles.** `users.accountType` is `'acro'` (a brand — posts pitches, invites,
  replies) or `'assent'` (watches, follows, votes — can never own a brand). Chosen
  once at registration (`RegisterForm`'s role picker), no UI to switch later yet.
  The only enforcement point is `createBrand` (`src/app/actions/brand.ts`) — every
  other Acro-only action already requires a brand via `getBrandForUser`, so gating
  brand creation gates everything downstream for free. Existing accounts were
  backfilled by the migration: anyone already in `brand_members` became `'acro'`,
  everyone else `'assent'`.
- **Renamed UI vocabulary** (internal code — table/column names, `battle.ts`,
  `/app/actions/battle.ts`, etc. — deliberately untouched, this was a copy + routing
  pass, not a rewrite):
  - "Battle" → **Pitch**. `/battles` and `/battles/[id]` are now `/pitches` and
    `/pitches/[id]`.
  - "Herausfordern" (challenge) → **Einladen** (invite). "Annehmen"/"Ablehnen"
    (accept/decline) are unchanged.
  - "Kontern" (counter) → **Antworten** (reply) — the ⚔️ is gone.
  - Earlier phase notes above still say "Herausfordern"/"Battle"/"Kontern" since
    that's what the UI said when each phase shipped — this section is the one place
    documenting the rename itself.
- **Comments.** A flat, TikTok/Reels-style comment thread under every Pitch
  (`comments` table, `src/lib/comment.ts`, `src/app/actions/comment.ts`,
  `CommentSection` component) — newest first, anyone signed in can post (Acro or
  Assent, including a Pitch's own brands), visible at every stage including
  `awaiting_videos`. No edit/delete UI yet, no nested replies — a known rough edge,
  not a blocker for testing whether comments add anything.

**Phase 9 — the feed (TikTok/Reels-style, the new home screen):**

Product direction, verbatim: make the home screen a real full-screen, vertically-
scrolling video feed — "das wird die Revolution", "so wie man es kennt" — with the
standard social actions (Like, Comment, Share) plus voting worked in wherever a
video belongs to a Pitch, and a way to see both what's trending and what brands you
follow just posted.

- **`/` *is* the feed now**, for everyone, logged in or not (`src/app/page.tsx` →
  `FeedClient`). One full-screen video per swipe, scroll-snap (`snap-y
  snap-mandatory` + `snap-start snap-always`), autoplay/pause driven by a per-card
  `IntersectionObserver` (plays once ≥60% visible, pauses otherwise — no shared
  "one video at a time" coordinator needed since scroll-snap already guarantees
  only one card is ever mostly-visible at a time). Tap a video to mute/unmute (starts
  muted, autoplay-safe). Register/login now redirect to `/` instead of `/profile`.
- **One card per battle *side*, not per battle.** "Das Video ist der ganze
  Bildschirm" — a battle has two videos, so it produces two feed cards, each full-
  screen, each with its own like count. A card only exists once both sides of its
  battle are actually visible under the existing Phase 7 "hidden results" rule
  (`stage.stage === "voting"` or `"finished"`/`"voted"`) — nothing pre-reveal, no
  walkover/no-show, ever shows up in the feed. `src/lib/feed.ts` is the query
  layer; `getForYouFeed`/`getFollowingFeed`.
- **Two tabs**, mirroring TikTok's own For You/Following split — the product ask
  ("Trending oder For You oder was Neues" + "gefolgte Firmen posten neue Pitches")
  collapses cleanly into exactly this:
  - **Für dich** — every live/finished Pitch, ranked by a *live-computed* trending
    score (`trendingScore()` in `src/lib/feed.ts`) — engagement (likes + 1.5×
    comments + 2× votes) divided by a recency decay. Not persisted or cached, same
    philosophy as `getBattleStage()`/`effectiveStatus()` elsewhere in this app:
    recompute from current counts every time rather than let a cached rank drift.
    Fine at today's scale; revisit if it ever stops being cheap.
  - **Folge ich** — only cards from brands the viewer follows
    (`getFollowedBrandIds()`, new in `src/lib/follow.ts`), newest first. Empty state
    prompts to follow brands (or log in, if logged out) — this is also the tab that
    answers "did a brand I follow just post something".
  - A `FollowButton` sits right on each feed card next to the brand name, so
    discovering a brand in "Für dich" and following it happens without leaving the
    feed.
- **Like** — a heart, independent of voting (`likes` table above). Optimistic on
  tap, backed by `POST /api/feed/like`.
- **Comment** — opens a bottom sheet (`CommentSheet`) over the feed reusing the
  same `comments` table/thread as the `/pitches/[id]` page — post from either
  place, see it in both.
- **Vote** — a single button per card, "🏆 Für {brand} stimmen", since a feed card
  only shows one side at a time (you'd scroll to the other card to vote for the
  opponent instead). Same rules as `/pitches/[id]`'s vote panel, same hidden-until-
  finished split — `castVoteForUser()` in `src/lib/vote.ts` is now the one shared
  implementation both the Pitch page's form action and the feed's vote API call
  into (a small refactor, not a behavior change).
- **Share** — deliberately scoped down to a real share link (native
  `navigator.share()`, clipboard-copy fallback), not an in-app "send to a friend"
  DM — that would need a whole friends/messaging system this phase didn't call
  for. The link points at `/pitches/[id]`, which already shows the full pitch
  (both sides, vote panel, comments).
- **Why route handlers, not Server Actions, for like/vote/comment here.** Every
  other write in this app so far is a Server Action ending in `refresh()` — fine
  for a form on an otherwise-static page, wrong for an infinite-scroll video feed,
  where re-rendering the whole route on every tap would reset scroll position and
  interrupt playback. `/api/feed`, `/api/feed/like`, `/api/feed/vote`,
  `/api/feed/comments` are plain JSON route handlers instead; the feed client
  patches its own local state after each response.
- **A persistent bottom nav** (`src/components/nav/bottom-nav.tsx`, mounted in
  `src/app/layout.tsx`) — Feed / Pitches / Marken / Profil-or-Anmelden — floats
  over the feed the same way TikTok's own nav does, and sits below the normal
  page padding (`py-16`) everywhere else.
- **Deliberately out of scope:** an in-app friends/DM system for "Teilen" (see
  above), any persisted/cached trending score, and video transcoding/thumbnailing
  (unchanged from Phase 3 — still relying on the browser's own `<video>` decoding).
- **Superseded by Phase 9.1, immediately below:** the "one card per battle side"
  design and the "Für dich" tab name. Kept here as a record of what shipped first
  and why; read on for what changed and why.

**Phase 9.1 — one feed entry per Duell, not per side (and no more "Für dich"):**

User feedback on Phase 9, verbatim: *"Ja es darf aber keine Kopie sein, du musst
es neu machen damit wir keine Probleme bekommen. Zum Beispiel statt for you,
Feed. Grundsätzlich: machst du einfach nur das was ich schreibe oder überlegst du
auch selber wie du das findest? [...] Ein User öffnet die App, er möchte neue
Videos von den Firmen sehen, das ist der Feed. Wie sieht man dann ein Duell
Pitch? [...] Hast du Lösungen?"* Two real problems, not one:

1. **"Für dich" is TikTok's own tab name**, not a generic term — a legal risk for
   a product whose whole pitch is being an original platform, not a TikTok clone.
2. **The per-side-card design quietly broke the Duell concept.** A feed is one
   video at a time; splitting a battle into two independent cards meant a viewer
   could scroll past brand A's video, never see brand B's, and never get a
   moment where voting "on this Duell" actually made sense — the feed showed
   videos, not Duelle.

Fix, chosen from three options put to the user (`AskUserQuestion`; picked
"Swipe zur Antwort"):

- **One feed entry = one Duell**, not one per side. `src/lib/feed.ts`'s
  `buildFeedDuels()` replaces the old `buildFeedItems()`: a `FeedDuel` now
  carries `sides: [FeedDuelSide, FeedDuelSide]` (index 0 = brand A, index 1 =
  brand B, matching `tally.brandAVotes`/`brandBVotes`) plus one shared
  `commentCount` and `tally` — vertical scroll-snap moves between *different*
  Duelle, exactly one full-screen video on screen at a time, same as before.
- **Flipping to the other side happens in place**, without leaving that feed
  position: `FeedDuelCard` mounts both side videos absolutely-stacked (only the
  active one visible/playing, the other paused-but-loaded so switching is
  instant, no reload, no flicker) and switches on a tap-zone (left third /
  right third of the screen = that side, middle third = mute toggle — chosen
  deliberately as a new, two-state mechanic rather than reusing any specific
  existing app's story-paging UI) or the explicit "↔ Antwort von {brand}
  ansehen" button under the video. A dot indicator + edge chevrons (‹ ›) show
  there's a second side to see.
  Voting, liking and the follow button all act on whichever side is currently
  shown; liking is still per-side (two hearts, two counts, one per brand),
  voting and comments are still shared per Duell (one tally, one thread — a
  vote is "for a side of this Duell", not "for this card").
- **No separate "Pitches" tab was added.** The user asked about this directly;
  `/pitches` already lists every Duell (both sides, full vote panel, comments) —
  the feed's "beide direkt vergleichen" link on every card points there for
  anyone who wants the non-swipe view instead.
- **Tab renamed:** "Für dich" → **Feed** (the "Folge ich" tab is unchanged — it
  now opens each Duell on whichever side the viewer follows, via a new
  `initialSideIndex`, instead of a separate card per followed brand).
- `feed-video-card.tsx` (Phase 9's per-side card) is deleted; `feed-duel-card.tsx`
  replaces it. A `data-battle-id` attribute was added to the card's root element
  — not a product change, but worth noting: it's what makes the card reliably
  locatable in tests across a side switch, since class-based selectors on the
  currently-visible side go stale the moment the side flips.
- No schema change — the `likes`, `comments`, and `votes` tables and their APIs
  (`/api/feed/like`, `/api/feed/vote`, `/api/feed/comments`) were already
  Duell/side-agnostic enough to need no changes, just a client that now points
  them at whichever side is active.

**Phase 10 — Pitches becomes "coming next", plus a real notifications screen:**

Follow-up product discussion, verbatim from the user: after Phase 9.1 made a Feed card
do everything the old `/pitches/[id]` detail page did (video, vote, comment, switch
sides), he pointed out the two screens had become near-duplicates with no good reason —
*"wo ist also der Unterschied bei diesen Tabs?"* — and separately flagged that a
"favorite/reminder" mechanic needs somewhere to live, or a reminder can be set, the Pitch
can go live, get missed in the Feed, and then be un-findable — *"man weiß nicht mehr was
man sehen wollte."* Two changes, agreed via a quick multiple-choice question plus his own
follow-up idea:

- **`/pitches` is now a "coming next" preview, not a second way to watch.** It only lists
  Duelle still in `awaiting_videos` — both brand names, the platform's idea/category text
  (`battle.category`), and the submission deadline. The instant both videos are in, a
  Duell disappears from this list; from then on it exists only in the Feed. No more
  stage badges or vote counts here — those belonged to the old "watch it here too" version
  of this page.
- **`🔔 Erinnern`** (`src/lib/reminder.ts`, `battle_reminders` table) — a reminder on one
  specific upcoming Duell, deliberately separate from `follows`: works even if you don't
  follow either brand yet. `activateBattleIfBothSidesReady()` in `battle-stage.ts` now
  fans out to reminder-setters too when a Pitch goes live, with distinct wording
  ("Dein vorgemerkter Pitch ist live") from the existing follow-based notification, and
  skips anyone already covered by a follow so nobody gets notified twice.
- **`/pitches/[id]` is now only the waiting room.** Upload form for your own brand,
  comments (still visible pre-reveal, unchanged from Phase 8), and the walkover/no-show
  outcome messages. The moment a battle's stage is `voting` or `finished`+`voted`, this
  page `redirect()`s straight to `/?battle=<id>` — every existing link into this page
  (accepting a challenge, an open-mode counter that's instantly live, a notification, an
  old bookmark) keeps working, it just lands in the Feed instead of a second video-viewing
  UI. `getFeedDuelById()` in `feed.ts` and a `?battle=` param on `page.tsx` make that deep
  link land scrolled to the right card (`FeedClient` reads `data-battle-id` to scroll to
  it on mount) rather than at the top of the ranked list.
- **A real `/notifications` screen** (`src/components/nav/bottom-nav.tsx` gained a 🔔 tab
  with an unread-count badge) — previously notifications only showed as a small block on
  `/profile`, which is exactly how one could get lost. Every notification (follow-based or
  reminder-based) stays listed here, read or not, and links straight into the Feed. The
  Profile page now just shows a one-line teaser linking to this screen instead of
  duplicating the list.
- **Deliberately out of scope:** push/email delivery for notifications (still in-app
  only, unchanged since Phase 5.1); a way to browse/search *finished* Duelle outside the
  Feed's own pagination — the user's call was that a fizzled (walkover/no-show) or
  finished Duell not showing up anywhere public isn't a loss, since it was never real
  content to browse.

**Phase 11 — demo content, and an independent product/tech review:**

A fresh session picked this up cold, read the original master prompt (the 36-section
vision doc — ELO ratings, tournaments, brand verification, anti-manipulation, monetization
— all deliberately out of scope for the MVP per that same doc's own §24/§35) plus this
README, then actually opened the live Vercel deployment. Finding: the live feed only had
the leftover QA rows from manual Phase 7 testing ("Live P7 A", "P7 Counter Live") — no
real or even fictional content. That fails the master prompt's own North Star test
(§36 — "würde jemand das heute Abend öffnen, nur um zu sehen was gerade battelt?") outright:
there was nothing to see. Since real brand signups take outreach this session can't do,
the fix that's actually buildable right now is realistic *fictional* demo content (the
master prompt's own §30 asked for this from day one and it was never done).

- **`scripts/generate-demo-videos.sh`** — generates 16 short vertical (540×960, 15s,
  ~50-100KB each) placeholder pitch videos with ffmpeg (colored background + brand
  name/tagline via `drawtext`), committed under `public/demo/videos/`. Deliberately not
  real brand logos/footage (the master prompt explicitly warns against using real brand
  assets without rights) and not real company names either — Coca-Cola/Pepsi/Nike/Adidas
  in the master prompt were illustrative of the *concept*, not a literal instruction to
  depict real, trademarked companies "losing" a vote. Served as static files (Next.js
  serves anything under `public/` automatically on Vercel) — no Supabase Storage
  credentials needed for demo content specifically.
- **`src/db/seed-demo.ts`** (`npm run db:seed-demo`) — 16 fictional brands across 8
  categories (Food, Fashion, Beauty, Tech, Automotive, Gaming — matching the master
  prompt's category list), each an explicit Goliath-vs-David pair, and 18 battles across
  every real stage: finished (blowouts, a giant-killer upset, a 50.2/49.8 nail-biter),
  live with real vote counts and days-left countdowns, and `awaiting_videos` (both sides
  missing, or just one) so `/pitches` has real content too. Plus 150 synthetic viewer
  accounts casting the votes/likes/comments, and follow counts weighted so Goliaths have
  visibly more followers than Davids. Fully namespaced (`@markitch.demo` emails, a
  fixed list of brand slugs) so re-running it is always safe: it wipes and recreates only
  its own rows, in prod or in dev, never touching a real account. Demo accounts share one
  password (printed by the script) so the user can log in as any demo brand to test the
  Acro-side UI without creating a real account.
- **Bugfix found during this review's own testing, unrelated to the above:**
  `BottomNav` used `href` as the React list key. Logged out, the 🔔 "Erinnerungen" tab and
  👤 "Anmelden" tab both point at `/login`, so React saw a duplicate key and warned in the
  console (harmless today, but exactly the kind of thing that silently drops/duplicates a
  tab on a future React version). Fixed by keying on `label` instead, which is always
  unique across the five tabs.
- **Deliberately out of scope for this phase** (flagged for the next ones, prioritized by
  impact on "opens the app every 10 minutes"): web push notifications — in-app-only
  notifications can't drive a return-to-app habit, since nothing tells you to look; a
  brand win/loss record + rivalry history shown on `/brands/[slug]` (the underlying vote
  data already supports this, it just isn't surfaced — a near-free win); dynamic
  share cards/OG images per Pitch (today's share is a bare link — the master prompt's
  §21 "a $2M startup is destroying a $40B company" hook needs an actual generated
  image+headline to work as a share card); the 15-second constraint isn't enforced
  anywhere technically (any video length uploads fine).

**Phase 12 — result freezes at the deadline, voting never actually stops, push
notifications when a result is in:**

Direct product feedback, same session as Phase 11: the Feed's rebuild (Phase 9) had
silently dropped Phase 7's "show the running vote count, never the split, until voting
closes" behavior — after voting, `VoteState` just said "✓ du hast abgestimmt" and nothing
else, no FOMO/social-proof count, because `VotePanel` (the component that actually had
this) had quietly become dead code once Phase 10 made the Feed the only place a live
Pitch is ever watched. Also requested: notify a voter automatically the moment their
Pitch's result is decided, and — since a real David-vs-Goliath story can keep playing out
after the "official" moment — let voting continue indefinitely instead of hard-closing it,
while still freezing an official result at the deadline so "who actually won" stays a fixed
fact.

- **`VotePanel` and its orphaned server action (`src/app/actions/vote.ts`) are
  deleted** — fully unreachable since Phase 10, and keeping unreachable code that *looks*
  like the current vote UI around is exactly how a regression like the one above happens
  again. `FeedDuelCard`'s `VoteState` (`src/components/feed/feed-duel-card.tsx`) is now the
  one implementation of "hide the split, show the count."
- **Two tallies, not one** (`src/lib/vote.ts`): `getVoteTally()` (existing) is now
  explicitly the *live*, ever-growing count; a new `getVoteTallyAsOf(battleId, ..., asOf)`
  reproduces the tally as it stood at any timestamp — used with `votingEndsAt` to compute
  the *official*, frozen result. `castVoteForUser` never had a deadline check to begin
  with, so no change was needed there to let voting continue — the gap was purely that the
  UI stopped offering a vote button once a Pitch was finished, and that `getBattleStage`'s
  winner was being computed from the live tally, which would have let it silently flip if
  anyone voted after the deadline. Both fixed: the winner shown as "finished" is always
  computed from the frozen tally now (`src/lib/feed.ts`), and the vote button stays
  available to anyone who hasn't voted, finished or not.
- **The Feed shows both.** Before a Pitch finishes: just the running total, never the
  split (Phase 7's original reasoning — showing who's ahead risks a bandwagon effect).
  Once finished: the frozen "Ergebnis" always shows; a second "🔄 Aktuell" line only
  appears once the live tally has actually diverged from it (someone voted after the
  deadline) — so a Pitch quietly sitting at its frozen result looks exactly like before,
  and only the ones where the story keeps moving show the extra line. Tested end-to-end
  with two fresh accounts voting on opposite sides of an already-"finished" demo Pitch —
  screenshots confirmed both the frozen result and the diverging live count render
  correctly on each side.
- **Web push** (`web-push` package; `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` /
  `VAPID_SUBJECT` env vars — a keypair this app generated for itself, not a third-party
  credential): `public/sw.js` is a minimal service worker (show notification, focus/open
  the app on click); `src/lib/push-client.ts` registers it and subscribes; a new
  `push_subscriptions` table (migration `0011`) stores one row per browser a user's
  granted permission on; `POST /api/push/subscribe` saves it. The opt-in
  (`src/components/feed/push-opt-in.tsx`) appears exactly once, right after a viewer's
  *first* vote in a session — the one moment "tell me when this is decided" is obviously
  useful — and never nags again regardless of the answer (`localStorage`).
- **No cron job.** There's no scheduled task anywhere in this app (matches
  `battle-stage.ts`'s existing "compute everything at read time" philosophy) — a Vercel
  Hobby-plan cron is limited to once a day anyway, which would make "the moment the result
  is in" a lie. Instead, `src/lib/feed.ts`'s `buildFeedDuels` (the function every feed load
  already calls) uses `after()` (`next/server`, confirmed present in this Next.js 16 build
  — see `node_modules/next/dist/server/after/`) to schedule `finalizeAndNotifyBattle()`
  (`src/lib/battle-notify.ts`) right after the response is sent, for any battle that just
  turned out finished-and-voted with `battles.result_notified_at` still `NULL`. That column
  doubles as the concurrency guard — the `UPDATE ... WHERE result_notified_at IS NULL` only
  succeeds once even if several requests race to finalize the same battle, so pushes never
  go out twice. On a platform whose whole premise is people checking back every few
  minutes, this fires close to real-time in practice, for free, on any Vercel plan.
- **`GET /api/admin/seed-demo?key=...`** — the demo-content seed from Phase 11
  (`seedDemoContent()`, now factored out to `src/lib/seed-demo-data.ts` so both this route
  and `npm run db:seed-demo` share one implementation) is also reachable as a plain URL,
  gated by an `ADMIN_SEED_KEY` env var compared against the `key` query param. The point:
  seeding a fresh Vercel deployment's prod database should never require anyone to copy a
  Supabase connection string into a terminal — visiting one URL after each deploy does it.
  Safe to visit more than once (re-rolls the same namespaced demo rows, see
  `seedDemoContent`'s own comment).
- **Not done yet, flagged for later:** an unsubscribe/manage-notifications UI (today,
  denying the browser permission prompt is the only way out); notifications for anything
  other than "your voted Pitch has a result" (a new challenge, a live-follower alert, etc.
  still in-app-only); re-prompting a viewer who dismissed the opt-in but later changes
  their mind (they'd have to be offered it again some other way — no UI for that yet).

## 4. The two-real-inboxes test

This is the test described for Phase 1 — two different people, two real inboxes,
against the deployed app:

1. Account A signs up with their email, Account B (a second real person) signs up
   with theirs.
2. Both receive a verification email and confirm.
3. Account A clicks "Passwort vergessen", gets a reset email, sets a new password,
   logs in with it.

For this to work with two different real inboxes, Resend needs a verified sending
domain (see below) — until then, only the Resend account owner's own address can
receive mail, and everyone else's flow has to be tested via the printed console link.

## 5. Deploying

### Supabase (database)

1. Create a project at supabase.com.
2. Project Settings → Database → Connection string → copy the **Transaction
   pooler** URL (port 6543) — required for Vercel's serverless functions.
3. Set that as `DATABASE_URL` (locally in `.env.local`, and in Vercel's env vars).
4. Run `npm run db:migrate` once against that URL (from your machine, with
   `DATABASE_URL` pointed at Supabase) to create the tables.

### Vercel (hosting)

1. Push this repo to GitHub (see below), then import it at vercel.com/new.
2. Add environment variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `APP_URL` (your
   `https://<project>.vercel.app` URL, or custom domain), `RESEND_API_KEY`,
   `EMAIL_FROM`, plus the Phase 12 ones below.
3. Deploy. Vercel builds and runs `next build` automatically.
4. After each deploy, visit `https://<your-app>/api/admin/seed-demo?key=<ADMIN_SEED_KEY>`
   once to (re)populate the demo content from Phase 11 — see that section above.

### Push notifications (Phase 12) — required env vars

Three more environment variables, all self-generated (not a third-party account):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` — a keypair for signing push
  messages. Generate a fresh pair with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`, or reuse the
  ones from this phase's delivery message. `VAPID_SUBJECT` (e.g.
  `mailto:you@example.com`) is required by the push spec but not otherwise used.
- `ADMIN_SEED_KEY` — any random string (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 24`) — the shared
  secret for the `/api/admin/seed-demo` URL above.

Without these set, the app still runs fine — `isPushConfigured()` in `src/lib/push.ts`
makes push a no-op rather than an error, and the seed endpoint just returns a clear 500
telling you `ADMIN_SEED_KEY` isn't set yet.

### Resend (email) — and the domain question

Without a verified domain, Resend's shared `onboarding@resend.dev` sender can only
deliver to the **Resend account's own email address** — not to any other inbox. This
is a Resend restriction, not something this app can work around in code.

To actually email two different people (the Phase 1 test), verify a domain in
Resend:

1. resend.com → Domains → Add Domain.
2. Add the DNS records it gives you at your domain registrar.
3. Once verified, set `EMAIL_FROM="MarkItch <noreply@yourdomain.com>"` in
   Vercel's env vars.

If there's no domain yet, everything still works end-to-end via the server-log
fallback — every email is printed to Vercel's function logs regardless of whether
Resend is configured, so links can be copied from there while testing.

### Supabase Storage (brand logos) — optional until deployed

Without it, uploaded logos are written to the local filesystem
(`public/uploads/...`), which is fine for local dev but doesn't persist on Vercel
(its filesystem is ephemeral/read-only outside `/tmp`). To make logo uploads work in
production:

1. Supabase dashboard → Storage → New bucket → name it `public-media`, make it
   **public**.
2. Project Settings → API → copy the **Project URL** and the **service_role** key
   (not the anon key — uploads need write access).
3. Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in Vercel's env vars. Leaving
   them unset just keeps using the local-disk fallback, which is harmless in dev.
